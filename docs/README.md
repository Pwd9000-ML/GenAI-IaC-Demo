# Welcome to the GenAI-IaC-Demo Wiki

## Overview
Welcome to the GenAI-IaC-Demo! This project demonstrates how you can leverage Generative AI to accelerate the development of bespoke Terraform modules. By integrating Azure AI Studio, we aim to boost Infrastructure as Code (IaC) productivity and streamline your documentation process. Also helps in understanding the Terraform configurations.

In this demo, you will see how non-Terraform consumers of the modules can use an AI assistant to help them interpret the code and documentation. The AI assistant can provide detailed explanations, generate examples of usage, and offer insights into the Terraform configurations. This makes it easier for users of all skill levels to understand and utilize the Terraform modules effectively.

By harnessing the power of Azure AI Studio and private IaC data and documentation, we can create comprehensive and user-friendly AI assistants, ensuring that everyone can benefit, learn and understand private custom created Terraform modules.

## What You'll Learn
In this demo, you will learn how to:
- How to get started with Azure AI Studio using your own data and documentation (Specifically IaC).
- How to create an AI assistant to interpret and explain Terraform modules and documentation.
- Use Generative AI as assistant to interpret, create and manage Terraform modules from bespoke IaC data and documentation.
- Innovatively use AI to boost IaC productivity and streamline processes.
- How to use AI to help users understand and utilize Terraform modules effectively and generate examples of usage based on the bespoke IaC data and documentation.
