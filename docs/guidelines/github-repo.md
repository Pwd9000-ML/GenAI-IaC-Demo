## Best Practices for Managing GitHub Repositories at Contoso

At Contoso, effective management of GitHub repositories is essential for fostering collaboration, maintaining code quality, and streamlining workflows. This guide provides training and guidelines for users who want to start using GitHub to collaborate and contribute their code using Git repositories on GitHub.

## Tip 1: Use a Clear Repository Naming Convention

A clear repository naming convention in GitHub is vital as it helps with organization and clarity, which are crucial in a collaborative environment.

A clear repository naming convention makes it easier to:

- Identify the purpose and content of a repository at a glance.
- Search and retrieve repositories more effectively.
- Adopt a standardised approach across teams and projects.
- Implement automation to work more effectively by predicting the structure and naming of repositories. For example, CI/CD workflows can deploy versions based on naming conventions.

Let's look at some examples:

- **Prefix by Project or Team**: If your organization has several projects or teams, you could start with a prefix that identifies them, e.g., `teamalpha_authentication_service` or `teambravo_data_pipeline`.
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Repositories should have descriptive and specific names that tell you what's inside, e.g., `customer_support_ticketing_system` or `machine_learning_model_trainer`.
- **Include the Technology Stack**: It can be useful, particularly for microservices architectures, to include the primary technology stack in the name, e.g., `image_processor_python` or `frontend_react_app`.
- **Versioning or Status Tags**: If you maintain different versions of a tool or library, or when a repository holds something at a specific stage of development, indicate this within the name, e.g., `payment_gateway_v2` or `inventory_management_deprecated`.
- **Avoid Special Characters**: Stick to simple alphanumeric characters and hyphens/underscores to maintain URL compatibility and avoid confusion, e.g., `invoice-generator` or `invoice_generator`.
- **Use Case**: Sometimes indicating whether the repository is a library, service, demo, or documentation can be helpful, e.g., `authentication_lib`, `payment_api_service`, `demo_inventory_app`, `api_documentation`.

By adhering to a clear and standardised repository naming convention, you ensure that everyone on the team can navigate repositories more efficiently, anticipate the nature and content of each repository before delving into it, and work cohesively with an intuitive structure guiding them. This ultimately leads to better collaboration, time-saving, and fewer mistakes, allowing teams to focus on building and deploying rather than being bogged down with organizational confusion.

## Tip 2: Classify Repositories with Topics at Contoso

At Contoso, we utilise GitHub's **topics** feature to classify and organize our repositories effectively. Topics are labels that can be added to repositories to help categorize and discover projects. They are a great way to organize and group repositories based on their purpose, technology stack, or any other relevant criteria.

### How to Add Topics

To add topics to a repository, navigate to the repository's **About** settings, select **edit repository details**, and then choose the **Topics** tab. You can then add topics that are relevant to the repository.

### Benefits of Using Topics

Adding topics to repositories at Contoso offers several advantages:

- **Discoverability**: Topics make it easier for others to find your repository. When someone searches for a topic, repositories with that topic will be included in the search results.
- **Organization**: Topics help you organize your repositories. You can group repositories based on their purpose, technology stack, or any other relevant criteria.
- **Community**: Topics help you connect with others who are interested in the same subjects. When someone views a repository with a topic, they can see other repositories with the same topic.
- **Insights**: Topics provide insights into the technologies and tools that are popular within Contoso. You can use this information to identify trends and make informed decisions about the technologies and tools you use.
- **Standardization**: Topics help you standardize the way you categorize repositories. You can use the same topics across all your repositories to ensure consistency.

### Choosing Relevant Topics

When adding topics to a repository, it's important to choose topics that are relevant and meaningful. Select topics that accurately describe the purpose, technology stack, or other relevant criteria of the repository.

For more information on topics and how to use them effectively, refer to the [GitHub repo topics documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics?wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5004771).

## Tip 3: Use README.md to Document the Repository at Contoso

At Contoso, we understand that a well-documented repository is invaluable for developers, contributors, and maintainers. The `README.md` file is the first thing a visitor sees when they land on your repository. It's a great place to provide a quick overview of the repository, its purpose, and how to get started with it. It could include useful information such as:

- Project description
- Setup instructions
- Usage examples
- Contribution guidelines
- License information

A well-written `README.md` file can help you:

- **Attract Contributors**: Attract contributors to your project by providing them with the information they need to understand the project and get started with it.
- **Onboarding**: Help new team members get up to speed with the project by providing them with the information they need to understand the project and start contributing to it.
- **Documentation**: Serve as documentation for the project, providing users with the information they need to use the project.
- **Promotion**: Help promote your project by providing potential users with the information they need to understand the project and decide whether to use it.
- **Standardization**: Help standardize the way you document your projects by providing a consistent structure for documenting your projects.

When writing a `README.md` file, it's important to keep it concise and to the point. You should include the most important information at the top of the file and provide links to more detailed information where necessary. Use formatting to make the file easy to read, and include images and other media where appropriate.

For more information on how to write a good `README.md` file, refer to the [GitHub repo readme documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes?wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5004771).

## Tip 4: Embrace a Consistent Branching Strategy at Contoso

At Contoso, adopting a consistent branching strategy is crucial for effective collaboration and code management. A clear structure for managing and integrating code changes helps maintain a clean and stable codebase, reducing the risk of conflicts and errors.

Here are several branching strategies that you can adopt:

- **Gitflow**: A popular branching strategy that uses two main branches, `master` and `develop`, along with various supporting branches to aid parallel development and release management.
- **Feature Branching**: Each `feature` or task is developed in a dedicated branch and then merged into the `main` branch once complete.
- **Trunk-Based Development**: All changes are made directly to the `main` branch, with feature toggles or other techniques used to manage incomplete features.
- **GitHub Flow**: A lightweight branching strategy that uses a single `main` branch, with feature branches created for each new feature or bug fix.
- **GitLab Flow**: Similar to GitHub Flow, but with the addition of environments and release branches for managing the release process.
- **Release Branching**: A `release` branch is created from the `main` branch to prepare for a new release, and then merged back into the main branch once the release is complete.
- **Environment Branching**: Branches are used to manage different environments, such as `development`, `staging`, and `production`.

When choosing a branching strategy, consider the needs of your team and project. Select a strategy that is simple, flexible, and scalable, and that supports the way your team works. Document the branching strategy and ensure that everyone on the team understands and follows it consistently.

For more information on branching and how to use branches, refer to the [GitHub repo branch documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches?wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5004771).

By embracing a consistent branching strategy, Contoso ensures that our codebase remains organised, stable, and conducive to effective collaboration.

These rules help prevent mistakes and errors, improve the quality and security of our code, and ensure a smooth workflow.

Here are some ways you can use branch protection rules at Contoso:

- **Require Pull Request Reviews**: Ensure that a certain number of reviewers approve a pull request before it can be merged. This helps maintain code quality and catch potential issues early.
- **Require Status Checks**: Mandate that certain status checks, such as CI/CD checks, pass before a pull request can be merged. This ensures that the code meets our quality standards.
- **Require Conversation Resolution Before Merging**: Make sure all conversations on a pull request are resolved before it can be merged. This promotes clear communication and consensus.
- **Require Signed Commits**: Ensure that commits are signed with a verified signature before they can be merged. This adds an extra layer of security and authenticity to our code.
- **Require Linear History**: Enforce a linear commit history for pull requests before they can be merged. This keeps the commit history clean and easy to follow.
- **Require Merge Queue**: Use a merge queue, such as GitHub Actions or a third-party service, to run required checks on pull requests in a merge queue before merging. This helps manage the merging process efficiently.
- **Require Deployments to Succeed Before Merging**: Ensure that deployments to certain environments, such as production, succeed before a pull request can be merged. This guarantees that the code is deployable and functional in the target environment.

For more information on branch protection rules and how to use them, refer to the [GitHub repo branch protection documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches?wt.mc_id=DT-MVP-5004771).

When implementing branch protection rules at Contoso, it's important to strike a balance between enforcing restrictions and allowing your team to work effectively. Consider the needs of your team and project, and choose rules that support the way your team works. Document the rules and ensure that everyone on the team understands and follows them consistently.

## Tip 6: Maintain a Clean Commit History at Contoso

At Contoso, maintaining a clean commit history is essential for effective collaboration and code management. A well-organised commit history provides a clear record of changes, helps maintain a stable codebase, and makes it easier to understand the evolution of the project. It also reduces the risk of conflicts and errors.

Here are several best practices you can adopt to maintain a clean commit history:

- **Write Descriptive Commit Messages**: Ensure your commit messages are clear and descriptive, explaining the purpose and context of the changes made. This helps others understand the intent behind each change.
- **Use Atomic Commits**: Make small, focused commits that contain a single logical change. This practice makes it easier to track the history of the codebase and reduces the risk of conflicts and errors.
- **Use Meaningful Commit Titles**: Summarize the purpose of the changes in the commit title. A meaningful title provides a quick overview of what the commit entails.
- **Use Consistent Formatting**: Maintain a consistent format for your commit messages. Use the imperative mood and keep the first line to 50 characters or less. This consistency makes the commit history easier to read and understand.
- **Use Signed Commits**: Sign your commits to verify their authenticity and protect against tampering. Signed commits add an extra layer of security to your codebase.

By following these best practices, Contoso ensures that our commit history remains clean, organised, and easy to navigate. This approach fosters better collaboration, improves code quality, and helps maintain a stable and secure codebase.
