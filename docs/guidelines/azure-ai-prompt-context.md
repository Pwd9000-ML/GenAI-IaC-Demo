# AI context prompts

Prompts for context are crucial in AI applications for several reasons:

1. **Relevance and Accuracy:**
   - Context helps the AI understand the specific needs and goals of the user, ensuring that the responses are relevant and accurate. For example, knowing that the user is interested in DevOps practices with Azure and Terraform allows the AI to provide targeted and useful information.

2. **User Experience:**
   - Providing context enhances the user experience by making interactions more meaningful and personalised. It helps the AI to tailor its responses to the user's level of expertise, whether they are beginners or experienced professionals.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - Context allows the AI to process and respond to queries more efficiently. By understanding the broader scenario, the AI can anticipate follow-up questions and provide comprehensive answers that address multiple aspects of a topic.

4. **Consistency:**
   - Maintaining context throughout a conversation ensures that the AI's responses are consistent and coherent. This is particularly important in technical discussions where accuracy and clarity are paramount.

5. **Engagement:**
   - Contextual prompts make interactions more engaging by aligning the AI's responses with the user's interests and needs. This can lead to more productive and satisfying conversations.

6. **Problem-Solving:**
   - In complex scenarios, context helps the AI to break down problems and provide step-by-step guidance. For instance, in setting up a CI/CD pipeline, the AI can offer detailed instructions that consider the user's specific environment and tools.

Overall, context prompts are essential for creating intelligent, responsive, and user-friendly AI applications. They ensure that the AI can provide valuable insights and support tailored to the user's unique requirements.

## AI prompt examples (DevOps - IaC)

### Example 1

_"As a DevOps engineer and developer, you are creating an AI application aimed at a technical audience, including those who are learning about Infrastructure as Code. Your focus is on providing exceptional knowledge specifically in Microsoft Azure, using Terraform for IaC, GitHub and Azure DevOps, and covering general DevOps practices. You should cater to both experienced professionals and beginners, offering insights and practical guidance on setting up and managing infrastructure, implementing CI/CD pipelines, ensuring security and compliance, and fostering collaboration and continuous improvement within DevOps teams."_

### Example 2

_"As a DevOps engineer, you are responsible for setting up an end-to-end DevOps workflow. This includes automating the provisioning of infrastructure using Terraform to create and manage Azure resources such as virtual networks, storage accounts, and virtual machines. You will use GitHub for version control, implementing branching strategies and pull request workflows to manage code changes. Set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Ensure that monitoring and logging are configured using Azure Monitor and Log Analytics to track the performance and health of your applications and infrastructure. Implement security measures such as role-based access control (RBAC) and Azure Policy to enforce compliance and manage permissions. Throughout the process, emphasise automation to streamline tasks and foster a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement within your team."_

### More specific context examples

**End-to-End DevOps Workflow:**

_"As a DevOps engineer, you are tasked with setting up an end-to-end DevOps workflow. This includes using Terraform to provision Azure infrastructure, setting up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, implementing monitoring and logging with Azure Monitor, and ensuring security and compliance with Azure Policy. Describe the steps and best practices for achieving this."_

**Automated Infrastructure Deployment:**

_"You need to automate the deployment of a web application to Azure. Use Terraform to define the infrastructure, GitHub for version control, and GitHub Actions for the CI/CD pipeline. Ensure that monitoring and logging are set up using Azure Monitor, and implement security measures such as RBAC and Azure Policy. Outline the process and tools involved."_

**Collaborative DevOps Project:**

_"In a collaborative DevOps project, you are responsible for managing the infrastructure as code using Terraform, while your team uses GitHub for version control and collaboration. Set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to deploy the application to Azure, and configure monitoring and logging with Azure Monitor. Ensure that security and compliance are maintained throughout the process. Explain how you would coordinate with your team and manage the project."_

**Comprehensive DevOps Strategy:**

_"In a new project, develop a comprehensive DevOps strategy that includes using Terraform for infrastructure as code, GitHub for version control, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Incorporate monitoring and logging with Azure Monitor, and ensure security and compliance with Azure Policy. Discuss the key principles of DevOps that will guide your strategy and how you will implement them."_

**DevOps Best Practices Implementation:**

_"Implement DevOps best practices in your organisation by automating infrastructure provisioning with Terraform, setting up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, and using GitHub for version control. Ensure that monitoring and logging are configured with Azure Monitor, and that security and compliance are enforced with Azure Policy. Describe the benefits of these practices and how they contribute to the success of your projects."_
